    <center><h3>Basic Outline of Java</h3></center>
    <hr>
    <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that was originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere, thanks to its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability. The evolution of Java has seen significant changes and improvements over the years, from its initial release to the introduction of various versions, each adding new features and enhancements. Some of the key features of Java include its platform independence, strong memory management, automatic garbage collection, and a rich set of libraries, which make it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications, from web development to mobile app development.</h4>
