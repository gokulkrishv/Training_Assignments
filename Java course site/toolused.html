    <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">Java development relies on a variety of tools that enhance productivity and streamline the programming process. The cornerstone of Java development is the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes essential components such as the Java compiler, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), and various development tools. The JDK allows developers to write, compile, and run Java applications, making it a fundamental resource. Complementing the JDK, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) provides the necessary libraries and components to execute Java programs, ensuring that applications run smoothly on any platform that supports Java.</h4>
    <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">For a more efficient coding experience, developers often turn to Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans. These IDEs offer a rich set of features, including code completion, syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and project management capabilities, which significantly enhance the development process.</h4>
